Construction-
This system is made up of- 
1) 3 Arduino Uno board
2) 3 temperature sensors
3) 1 bread Board
4) 3 Servo Motors

Working-
- 3 temperature sensors and Servo motors are connected with 3 Arduino Uno Board respectively.
- Each Temp. Sensor and Servo motors are assigned to a single Room in which they are supposed to function.
-Each Servo motor is customized to control the pressure of emergency water sprinkler in the room.
-In an emergency when temperature rises due to supposedly fire inside the room the temperature sensor will measure the Intensity of the fire by its temperature.
-Sprinkler Pressure is assigned with 2 (can be increased) level. 
 1) temperature above 50 degrees Celsius- Servo motor would enable 50% of Water Pressure by opening up 90 
     degrees of its lever.
 2) temperature above 70 degrees Celsius- Servo motor would enable 100% of Water Pressure by opening up 180 degrees of its lever.

Use-
It is very Important to be conscious of emergency situations like fire break inside a room/building.
The most Important part of handling such situations is Evacuation from the fireplace, however while emergency water sprinklers flooding the place with high pressure water, it would be very difficult to do so.
Thus, this Idea of using only required amount of water pressure according to the situation and surrounding is very necessary.
