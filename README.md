# Construction
This system is made up of-
1) 3 Arduino Uno board
2) 3 temperature sensors
3) 1 bread Board
4) 3 Servo Motors

- Servo motor is installed on the entrace of the water sprinker system to manage the water pressure.
- Servo motor is connected to the respective Arduino Uno board.
- A temperature sensor will be introduced to the facility and would operate coordinately with the water system.
- The sensor then would be connected to the Aruino Uno board.

# Working
- 3 temperature sensors and Servo motors are connected with 3 Arduino Uno Board respectively. 
- Each Temp. Sensor and Servo motors are assigned to a single Room in which they are supposed to function.
- Each Servo motor is customized to control the pressure of emergency water sprinkler in the room.
- In an emergency when temperature rises due to supposedly fire inside the room the temperature sensor will measure the Intensity of the fire by its temperature.
- Sprinkler Pressure is assigned with 2 (can be increased) level. 
 1) temperature above 50 degrees Celsius- Servo motor would enable 50% of Water Pressure by opening up 90 
     degrees of its lever.
 2) temperature above 70 degrees Celsius- Servo motor would enable 100% of Water Pressure by opening up 180 degrees of its lever.
 More levels of water pressures can be introduced according to the needs.

# Use
It is very Important to be conscious of emergency situations like fire break inside a room/building.
The most Important part of handling such situations is Evacuation from the fireplace, however while emergency water sprinklers flooding the place with high pressure water, it would be very difficult to do so.
Thus, this Idea of using only required amount of water pressure according to the situation and surrounding is very necessary and useful.
