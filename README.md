# Construction
This system is made up of-
1) 3 Arduino Uno board
2) 3 temperature sensors
3) 1 bread Board
4) 3 Servo Motors

- Servo motor is installed on the entrance of the water sprinkLer system to manage the water pressure.
- Servo motor is connected to the respective Arduino Uno board.
- A temperature sensor will be introduced to the facility and would operate co-ordinately with the water system.
- The sensor then would be connected to the Arduino Uno board.

# Working
- 3 temperature sensors and Servo motors are connected with 3 Arduino Uno Board respectively. 
- Each Temp. Sensor and Servo motors are assigned to a single Room in which they are supposed to function.
- Each Servo motor is customized to control the pressure of emergency water sprinkler in the room.
- In an emergency when temperature rises due to supposedly fire inside the room the temperature sensor will measure the Intensity of the fire by its temperature.
- Sprinkler Pressure is assigned with 2 (can be increased) level. 
 1) temperature above 50 degrees Celsius- Servo motor would enable 50% of Water Pressure by opening up 90 
     degrees of its lever.
 2) temperature above 70 degrees Celsius- Servo motor would enable 100% of Water Pressure by opening up 180 degrees of its lever.
 More levels of water pressures can be introduced according to the needs.

# Use
It is crucial to maintain awareness of emergency situations such as fires occurring within enclosed spaces like rooms or buildings. Evacuation from the fire site is paramount in such scenarios. However, the effectiveness of evacuation can be hindered when emergency water sprinklers inundate the area with high-pressure water, creating obstacles and hazards for individuals attempting to escape. Therefore, implementing a system that adjusts water pressure based on the specific situation and surroundings is not only necessary but also highly beneficial in ensuring efficient emergency response and evacuation procedures.
